# TODO
0. Store DB as base64
1. Landing page shows most important characteristics like 
    - Number of events with total EUE exceeds the ## number
    - Same with LOLE
    - Top 1 ptile events
    - Event summary graph (like the ESIG report)
2. Users from the webpage can specify which regions need to be aggregated to get combined metric
3. PRASReport exports an assess function which automatically runs assess with Shortfall(), Surplus(), Flows(), and Utilization()
4. Event selector creates a tab for an event to show regional shortfall and flows etc
5. Does NEUE have to be reported as MWh/MWh
6. Explore how a directed graph can be stored in DuckDB, and how it can be drawn on a webpage with WASM-DuckDB
