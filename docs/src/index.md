The Probabilistic Resource Adequacy Suite (PRAS) provides an open-source,
research-oriented collection of tools for analysing the resource adequacy of a
bulk power system. The simulation methods offered support everything from
classical convolution-based analytical techniques through to high-performance
sequential Monte Carlo methods supporting multi-region composite reliability
assessment, including simulation of energy-limited resources such as storage.

PRAS is developed and maintained at the US
[National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/) (NREL).

For help installing PRAS, see the [instructions in the PRAS GitHub page](https://github.com/NREL/PRAS). To get started using PRAS, see the [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) page.
