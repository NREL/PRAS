The Probabilistic Resource Adequacy Suite (PRAS) provides an open-source, research-oriented collection of tools for analysing the resource adequacy of a
bulk power system.  It allows the user to simulate power system operations under a wide range of operating conditions in order to study the risk of failing to meet demand (due to a lack of supply or deliverability), and identify the time periods and regions in which that risk occurs. It offers high-performance sequential Monte Carlo methods supporting multi-region composite reliability assessment, including simulation of energy-limited resources such as storage.

PRAS is developed and maintained at the US
[National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/) (NREL).

To get started on using PRAS, see the [installation](./installation.md) and [getting Started](./getting-started.md) pages.
