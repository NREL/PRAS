# PRASBase

Core data structures for defining power systems in
[PRAS](https://github.com/NREL/PRAS).
Can also be used standalone to read or write PRAS-compatible systems as part of
a conversion process to/from some other system representation (e.g.
[PLEXOS2PRAS](https://github.com/NREL/PLEXOS2PRAS.jl)).
