The Probabilistic Resource Adequacy Suite (PRAS) is a collection of tools for
bulk power system resource adequacy analysis and capacity credit calculation.
The most recent documentation report (for version 0.6) is available
[here](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy21osti/79698.pdf).

# Installation

PRAS is written in the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) numerical programming
language. If you haven't already, your first step should be to install Julia.
Instructions are available at
[julialang.org/downloads](https://julialang.org/downloads/).

Once you have Julia installed, PRAS can be installed from the Julia [General registry](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/registries/) which is installed by default if you have no other registries installed.

From the main Julia prompt, type `]` to enter the package management REPL.
The prompt should change from `julia>` to something like `(v1.10) pkg>`
(your version number may be slightly different).
Type (or paste) the following (minus the `pkg>` prompt) 
```
pkg> add PRAS
```

This will automatically install the PRAS Julia module and all of its
related dependencies. At this point you can hit Backspace to switch back to the
main `julia>` prompt.

# Basic usage

With PRAS installed, you can load it into Julia as follows:

```Julia
using PRAS
```

This will make the core PRAS functions (most importantly, the `SystemModel`
and `assess` functions) available for use in your Julia script or
interactive REPL session.

The following snippet shows expected unserved energy (EUE) assessment for the [RTS-GMLC](https://github.com/GridMod/RTS-GMLC) system, which is packaged with PRAS. 

```Julia
rts_gmlc_sys = rts_gmlc();
shortfall, = assess(rts_gmlc_sys,
                    SequentialMonteCarlo(samples=10,seed=1),
                    Shortfall()
                    );
println("Total system $(EUE(shortfall))")
# Total system EUE = 0.00000 MWh/8784h
```

The [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) document provides more information
on using PRAS.
