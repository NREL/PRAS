    update!(::ResultAccumulator, ::NetworkState, t::Int, i::Int)::nothing

Records a simulation sample of supply, demand, and flows from timestep `t`
and simulation `i` in the provided `ResultAccumulator`.

Implementation note: This function should be thread-safe as it will
generally be parallelized across many time periods and/or samples during
simulations. This is commonly achieved by storing results in a
thread-specific temporary storage location in the `ResultAccumulator` struct
and then merging results from all threads during `finalize`.

For sequential simulation methods, results for a single simulation `i`
can be assumed to be generated serially on a single thread.

For nonsequential simulation methods, results for a single timestep `t`
can be assumed to be generated serially on a single thread.
